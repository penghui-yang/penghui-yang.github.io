- Propose a robust method called PC-AUC to solve pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification problems by minimizing pairwise surrogate losses
- Prove that there exists a linear dependence between the proposed loss and AUC
- Provide the estimation error bound for the proposed method and proved its consistency with respect to AUC
- Achieve comparable performance to baseline models on multiple datasets and validated the effectiveness of the proposed method
