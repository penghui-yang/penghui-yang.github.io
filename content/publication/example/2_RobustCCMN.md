abstract: This paper studies the robustness of multi-label loss functions under the Class-Conditional Multi-label Noise (CCMN), where multiple labels may be corrupted simultaneously with their respective probabilities. We disclose that the balanced hamming loss (BHL) and ranking loss (RL) are robust under CCMN, i.e., minimizing the risk over the corrupted distribution is equivalent to minimizing the true risk with respect to BHL and RL. Furthermore, we show that by using symmetric surrogate losses, the BHL and RL minimization can be achieved efficiently with ordinary SGD optimizer only based on corrupted data without knowing the noise rates. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets with diverse evaluation metrics validate the robustness of BHL and RL under CCMN.
