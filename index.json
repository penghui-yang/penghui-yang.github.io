We disclose that the balanced hamming loss (BHL) and ranking loss (RL) are robust under CCMN, i.e., minimizing the risk over the corrupted distribution is equivalent to minimizing the true risk with respect to BHL and RL. Furthermore, we show that by using symmetric surrogate losses, the BHL and RL minimization can be achieved efficiently with ordinary SGD optimizer only based on corrupted data without knowing the noise rates. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets with diverse evaluation metrics validate the robustness of BHL and RL under CCMN.","tags":[],"title":"On the Robustness of Loss Functions for Learning with Class-Conditional Multi-Label Noise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sheng-Jun Huang","Ming-Kun Xie","Peng-Hui Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"91b28a23828fddaedd2b41ac88e0d1f8","permalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/publication/example/1_pcauc/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/publication/example/1_pcauc/","section":"publication","summary":"Supervised learning often requires a large number of labeled examples, which has become a critical bottleneck in the case that manual annotating the class labels is costly. To mitigate this issue, a new framework called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification is proposed to allow training examples only weakly annotated with pairwise comparison, i.e., which one of two examples is more likely to be positive. The previous study solves Pcomp problems by minimizing the classification error, which may lead to less robust model due to its sensitivity to class distribution. In this paper, we propose a robust learning framework for Pcomp data along with a pairwise surrogate loss called Pcomp-AUC. It provides an unbiased estimator to equivalently maximize AUC without accessing the precise class labels. Theoretically, we prove the consistency with respect to AUC and further provide the estimation error bound for the proposed method. Empirical studies on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method","tags":[],"title":"Robust AUC Maximization for Classification with Pairwise Confidence Comparisons","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Generalize label-distribution-aware margin loss to ranking loss by minimizing a margin-based generalization bound ","date":1639526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639526400,"objectID":"01075ff62f9b91e9aa4bba0221391665","permalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/project/example/2_ltrank/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/project/example/2_ltrank/","section":"project","summary":" Generalize label-distribution-aware margin loss to ranking loss by minimizing a margin-based generalization bound ","tags":null,"title":"Pairwise LDAM Loss for Long-Tailed Multi-Label Classification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Propose a robust method called PC-AUC to solve pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification problems by minimizing pairwise surrogate losses Prove that there exists a linear dependence between the proposed loss and AUC Provide the estimation error bound for the proposed method and proved its consistency with respect to AUC Achieve comparable performance to baseline models on multiple datasets and validated the effectiveness of the proposed method ","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"3da52f73bac9451c8328f505f50414cf","permalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/project/example/1_pcauc/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"penghui-yang.github.io/project/example/1_pcauc/","section":"project","summary":" Propose a robust method called PC-AUC to solve pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification problems by minimizing pairwise surrogate losses Prove that there exists a linear dependence between the proposed loss and AUC Provide the estimation error bound for the proposed method and proved its consistency with respect to AUC Achieve comparable performance to baseline models on multiple datasets and validated the effectiveness of the proposed method ","tags":null,"title":"Robust AUC Maximization for Classification with Pairwise Confidence Comparisons","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peng-Hui Yang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
